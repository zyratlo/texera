# bin/local-dev.sh -- Manage the Texera local dev stack from a single script.

# Subcommands:

#                                             Non-interactive, prints once and
#                                             exits — safe in scripts/CI.

#   bin/local-dev.sh status [--json]          same as no-arg invocation. With

#                                             Default: skip build if no source/lock
#                                             changes since last build. --build forces
#                                             incremental sbt dist + yarn/bun install.
#                                             --fresh runs `sbt clean dist`.
#                                             --skip-build skips the build step
#                                             entirely. --json sends progress to

#                                             stdout.
#                                             With a service name, act on just that
#                                             service: rebuild it if its source

#                                             skips), then start/bounce it. The
#                                             single-service form follows the active
#                                             deployment; --fresh / --skip / the
#                                             deploy selectors are full-stack only.
#                                             DEPLOY SOURCE: with no selector a
#                                             full-stack `up` deploys THIS checkout.
#                                             Point it at a sibling git worktree with
#                                             --worktree=PATH or --branch=NAME (the
#                                             worktree that has NAME checked out) to
#                                             deploy a PR branch without disturbing the
#                                             main checkout. The choice is persisted, so
#                                             later status / down / logs / up <svc> /
#                                             auto all act on it (run a plain full-stack

#                                             local-dev.sh itself always runs from this

#                                             modifies bin/local-dev/**, those tooling
#                                             changes are NOT in effect; checkout that

# Docker infra (postgres / minio / lakefs / lakekeeper / litellm) IS managed
# here: `up` brings it up via `docker compose` (project texera-local-dev) and
# `down` tears down any docker targets. The script warns if expected ports are
# unreachable. Before any sbt build the postgres schema is reconciled: a fresh
# DB is bootstrapped from sql/texera_ddl.sql, and pending sql/updates/*.sql
# from sql/changelog.xml are applied automatically (tracked in liquibase's
# databasechangelog table) so jOOQ codegen sees the schema the code expects.
#
# Logs and pid book-keeping live under: ${TEXERA_LOCAL_DEV_DIR:-/tmp/texera-local-dev}

# --------- self tree vs deploy source ---------
# The orchestration tooling — this script, tui.py, and the docker overlay —
# always runs from the checkout it physically lives in: the "self" tree
# (normally the canonical `texera` clone). The *application* we build and run,
# though, can be redirected to a sibling git worktree so you can deploy a PR
# branch without disturbing the main checkout. That target is the "source"
# tree.
#
#   bin/local-dev.sh up --worktree=PATH    deploy from an explicit worktree dir
#   bin/local-dev.sh up --branch=NAME      deploy from the worktree that has

#   bin/local-dev.sh up                    deploy from this (self) checkout again
#
# The selection is persisted to $STATE_DIR/deploy-source, so every later
# command (status, logs, down, single-service up/down, auto) reads it back and
# acts on the SAME deployment. REPO_ROOT below is pointed at the source tree, which
# is what the rest of the script keys every build/run/git operation off of —
# only the handful of tooling-file paths are pinned to SELF_ROOT.
