Object-storage (S3) resolution helpers.

services fall back to the in-cluster RustFS Service and its auto-generated
"<release>-rustfs-secret" Secret, so the default install is unchanged.

The audience the mounter's service-account tokens are bound to. Fixed rather than
configurable: it is one half of a credential contract between access-control-service and the
mounter -- the projected token declares it and the mounter's TokenReview requires it -- so
the two must always agree, and there is no deployment in which a different value is useful.

The service-account username allowed to request a mount from the per-node mounter, in the
form MOUNTER_ALLOWED_CALLERS expects. This is access-control-service and nothing else: it
is the deployment's authorization authority for computing units, so it is the one component
that can decide whether a given user may mount into a given CU. Deliberately not
configurable -- widening it is a security decision, not a deployment preference, and a
values override would let an install quietly hand the privileged mounter to another caller.
