"""
texera-mounter: a per-node privileged service that performs GeeseFS FUSE mounts on behalf
of (unprivileged) computing-unit pods.

A permitted caller POSTs /mount with {cuid, repositoryName, commitHash, jwt,
fileServiceBase} once it has validated the JWT and the user's access to that computing
unit. "Permitted" is decided by the API server: the caller presents a service-account token
bound to MOUNTER_AUDIENCE and the mounter verifies it with TokenReview (see
authenticate_caller). Every path component of the request is validated here as well (see
CUID_PATTERN / PATH_SEGMENT_PATTERN), because authenticating the caller says who is asking,
not that what they asked for is a safe path. The mounter then runs GeeseFS
against file-service's JWT-authenticated S3 proxy (passing the user's JWT as the S3 access
key) and mounts read-only under MOUNT_ROOT/<cuid>/<repo>/<commit>.
That host directory is bind-mounted (mountPropagation: Bidirectional) into the mounter and
propagates back into the CU pod (mountPropagation: HostToContainer), so the CU pod sees
the mount without any privilege of its own.

The mounter holds no LakeFS credentials; authorization stays entirely in file-service.
A background watcher unmounts a CU's directories as soon as its pod is deleted.

# The mounter is the only privileged component in the mount path -- root on every node, with
# a hostPath and Bidirectional mount propagation -- and it listens on a hostPort, so anything
# routable to a node IP can reach it, including computing-unit pods running untrusted user
# code. Callers therefore present a Kubernetes service-account token bound to
# MOUNTER_AUDIENCE, which is verified here with the TokenReview API and matched against
# MOUNTER_ALLOWED_CALLERS. That check is enforced by the API server, unlike a NetworkPolicy,
# which is silently unenforced on CNIs that do not implement it and is routinely bypassed by
# hostPort traffic (DNAT'd at the node, so pod selectors never see it).
#
# An empty allow-list denies every request: the chart always sets this, and a mounter that
# cannot tell who is calling must not mount anything.
#
# The chart admits one caller, access-control-service, because that service is where the
# deployment already decides whether a user may act on a computing unit. The mounter itself
# cannot make that decision -- every request reaches it under one service identity, so it
# has no way to tell whose workflow is asking -- which is exactly why the component that
