# Stage coverage + test-result reports for the deferred Codecov upload
# (.github/workflows/codecov-upload.yml). Fork PRs get no CODECOV_TOKEN on the
# pull_request event, so the build stages its reports as a `codecov-<flag>`
# artifact instead of uploading inline; the workflow_run job re-uploads them with
# a token (see codecov-upload.yml / #6685).
#
# Produces ./cc/coverage/ (coverage reports), ./cc/results/ (JUnit XMLs), and the
# pr/sha/branch identifier files. Directory structure is preserved so same-basename
# reports (e.g. amber's per-module jacoco.xml across ~8 modules) do not collide;
# the deferred job points `directory:` at cc/coverage and cc/results so Codecov's
# recursive search finds every file under each.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   CC_COVERAGE  space-separated list of coverage sources — each a literal file or
#                a `find -path` glob (use * which matches across /), e.g.
#                "*/target/scala-2.13/jacoco/report/jacoco.xml". May be empty for a
#                test-results-only flag.
#   CC_RESULTS   same, for JUnit test-result XMLs.
#   CC_PR        PR number   (empty on push builds)
#   CC_SHA       head commit sha
#   CC_BRANCH    head branch
