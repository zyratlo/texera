/**
  * `portCompleted` is the request whose handling completes a region: once the last port of a
  * region is done, the region is terminated, which sends `EndWorker` to each of its workers.
  *
  * The reply to `portCompleted` and that `EndWorker` travel the same FIFO control channel to the
  * sending worker, so the region advance must NOT happen inline in this handler — it would put
  * `EndWorker` on the wire ahead of the reply, and the worker would then process `EndWorker` with
  * the reply still queued behind it and reject the termination (#6891). The advance is instead
  * requested as a coordinator-to-coordinator control message, which the coordinator can only
  * process in a later round — by which time this round's reply has been sent.
