    * flush. The real writer's `flush()` is `Output.flush()`, a no-op on an empty
    * buffer, so a flush with nothing buffered changes no durability and is not
    * worth a trace entry — and leaving it out keeps the trace independent of how
    * the writer thread happens to split its drain batches.

    * fail one test. Run the shutdown on a daemon thread and bound the wait, so a
    * wedge surfaces as an ordinary failed assertion instead.
    *
    * The trace is captured on the shutdown thread the instant `shutdown()`

    * thread. Swallowing it would turn, say, a NullPointerException from an
    * unstarted writer into a bare "expected List(...) but got List()" on an
    * empty trace, which points nowhere near the cause.
    *
    * If the budget does elapse, the parked thread is interrupted before we
    * return: `CompletableFuture.get()` is interruptible, so this actually
    * releases it instead of leaving it holding the writer for the rest of the
    * run. The interrupt is deliberately *not* reported as the failure — a wedge
    * is the caller's `returned == false`, and rethrowing the resulting
    * InterruptedException instead would rename the symptom after its own
    * remedy.

    *         the moment it returned).
