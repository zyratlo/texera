/**
  * Covers `UnifiedResourceSchema.apply` — the projection every search builder
  * unions into — and the de-duplication it performs behind `allFields`.
  *
  * Breakage this catches:
  *   - a projection slot wired to the wrong alias. Note the builders cannot drift
  *     from each other: the class constructor is private and every builder goes
  *     through this one `apply`, which pairs each expression with its own alias in
  *     the same tuple. So the slot-order assertion here is a lock on a centrally
  *     fixed projection shape (which `searchAllResources` unions positionally),
  *     not protection against one builder reordering columns — that is impossible;
  *   - the de-dup in `translatedFieldSet` changing from "keep the first alias
  *     per distinct original Field" to keep-last (or disappearing), which
  *     changes which alias `translateRecord` reads values out of;
  *   - jOOQ no longer comparing Fields structurally, which is the sole reason
  *     the de-dup collapses anything at all.
  *
  * `translateRecord` itself is out of scope: it calls `context.newRecord`, and
  * `context` is `SqlServer.getInstance().createDSLContext()`, so exercising it
  * would need a live database. Nothing here reads or writes the shared global
  * `FulltextSearchQueryUtils.usePgroonga`.
