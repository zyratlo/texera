/**
  * Covers `WorkflowSearchQueryBuilder.toEntryImpl`, the pure record-to-DTO
  * mapping, plus the one literal in `mappedResourceSchema` that the dashboard
  * dispatch depends on. Both members widen the trait's `protected` to public,
  * which is what makes them reachable from a spec at all.
  *
  * Breakage this catches:
  *   - the `projects` aggregate lookup breaking (a Field looked up by structural
  *     equality): `record.get(pidField)` would start returning null and every
  *     workflow would silently report zero projects instead of failing;
  *   - the comma-split branch losing/reordering ids, or the NULL branch no
  *     longer yielding an empty list;
  *   - a NULL `workflow_user_access.privilege` (a left join miss for public
  *     workflows) no longer degrading to NONE — an NPE or a wrong grant;
  *   - the ownership flag comparing the wrong uid, or owner id/name being read off
  *     the wrong column: two record columns are called `name` (WORKFLOW.NAME and
  *     USER.NAME), and `ownerId` resolves only because the unqualified name `uid`
  *     matches `workflow_of_user.uid` — the projection never selects USER.UID;
  *   - the inline `'workflow'` tag changing, which turns every "all resources"
  *     search into a MatchError in DashboardResource.searchAllResources.
  *
  * `constructFromClause`, `constructWhereClause` and `getGroupByFields` stay
  * `override protected`, and Scala `protected` grants no same-package access, so
  * they are not callable from here. (They are otherwise pure jOOQ DSL builders —
  * the access modifier is the only thing keeping them out of scope.)
  *
  * Nothing here reads or writes the shared global
  * `FulltextSearchQueryUtils.usePgroonga`, so this spec neither depends on it
  * nor mutates it.
