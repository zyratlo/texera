/**
  * Regression guard for the consolidated init-error reporting path (#5921):
  * `WorkflowExecutionService` registers its metadata-store diff handler at
  * construction, so a fatalErrors update -- e.g. the one `errorHandler` records
  * when `executeWorkflow` fails -- surfaces as a `WorkflowErrorEvent` through the
  * normal websocket-event observable.
  *
  * The unused `coordinatorConfig` / `resultService` are passed as `null` on
  * purpose: construction must stay side-effect-free (all throwing work is in
  * `executeWorkflow`), so a future change that dereferences them during
  * construction would fail here.
  *
  * The suite also owns two paths that need more scaffolding than that:
  *
  *   - `executeWorkflow`'s compilation-failure arm, driven for real (not simulated
  *     through `errorHandler`) with a CSV scan that has no file selected -- the
  *     recipe `SyncExecutionResourceSpec` establishes and `WorkflowServiceSpec`
  *     reuses. Compilation rejects it inside `LogicalPlan.resolveScanSourceOpFileName`
  *     before `FileResolver` is reached, so no storage is involved, and the early
  *     `return` stops the method before `ComputingUnitMaster.createAmberRuntime`,
  *     which would build an `AmberClient` on `AmberRuntime.actorSystem` -- null
  *     outside a started coordinator, and whatever another suite left behind inside
  *     the shared serial JVM.
  *
  *   - `unsubscribeAll`, the session-teardown contract. This is what makes the
  *     suite carry a TestKit `ActorSystem` and `MockTexeraDB`: the method walks the
  *     four runtime services, and `ExecutionStatsService`'s constructor creates its
  *     iceberg runtime-statistics table and stamps the URI onto a `workflow_executions`
  *     row, so a non-null value for that field cannot be had more cheaply. There is
  *     no second home for the test -- one spec file per source class -- and stubbing
  *     the services out would leave the four teardown calls unobserved, which is the
  *     entire content of the method.
  *
  * The runtime half of `executeWorkflow` (everything from `createAmberRuntime` on) is
  * out of reach here for the reason above and is exercised by the integration suites.
  *
  * Known, pre-existing: `ExecutionStatsService` never shuts down its private
  * `metricsPersistThread` (it does not override `unsubscribeAll`), so the teardown
  * test below leaks one single-thread executor into the shared JVM, as every
  * construction of that service already does.
  *
  * Three further gaps are deliberately described and NOT pinned, because a test that
  * froze the current behaviour would cement it:
  *
  *   - Partial construction. `executeWorkflow` assigns `client` first and the four
  *     services after it, and `WorkflowService` catches whatever they throw while
  *     leaving the half-built service published. `unsubscribeAll` then passes its
  *     `client != null` guard and NPEs on the first null service, aborting teardown.
  *
  *   - A recovery that ends in failure. `createStateEvent` carves out COMPLETED only,
  *     while the flag itself is lowered only by a `WorkflowRecoveryStatus(false)` from
  *     the engine, which an execution that dies mid-recovery need not ever send. Such an
  *     execution reaches FAILED with the flag still raised and is announced as
  *     "Recovering" from then on.
  *
  *   - `ExecutionReconfigurationService.registerWorkerCompletionCallback` discards the
  *     `Disposable` its `registerCallback` returns instead of handing it to
  *     `addSubscription`, so that one callback outlives the teardown below. Not this
  *     class's defect, and not this suite's to pin.
