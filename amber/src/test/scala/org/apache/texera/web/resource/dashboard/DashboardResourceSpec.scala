/**
  * Covers the connection-free surface of [[DashboardResource]]: the `orderBy`
  * translation and the resource-type dispatch guard.
  *
  * Breakage this catches:
  *   - a column of the `orderBy` grammar wired to the wrong unified-schema
  *     alias (e.g. `EditTime` sorting by creation time), which silently
  *     re-orders the dashboard instead of failing;
  *   - the `nullsLast()` on the descending branch being dropped or copied onto
  *     the ascending branch — under Postgres that flips where rows with a NULL
  *     execution time land;
  *   - the regex losing its implicit anchoring (`Regex.unapplySeq` requires a
  *     full match), which would start accepting junk like `SortByNameAsc`;
  *   - an unrecognised `orderBy` no longer degrading to "no ORDER BY", or the
  *     unknown-resourceType guard no longer throwing before the query is built.
  *
  * Note on the shared global `FulltextSearchQueryUtils.usePgroonga`: nothing
  * exercised here reads or writes it, so this spec neither depends on its value
  * nor mutates it (a "restore" would itself be a write, and amber's suites
  * share one JVM).
