/**
  * Unit tests for the websocket endpoint's message handling.
  *
  * The endpoint itself is thin, but two pieces of it are real logic that nothing else guards:
  *
  *   - the write-access gate on `WorkflowExecuteRequest`. It is the only consumer of the privilege
  *     `myOnOpen` parsed off the handshake, and denying it must both surface an error to the client
  *     and rethrow. Note this branch is unreachable in single-node mode, where
  *     `ServletAwareConfigurator` hard-codes WRITE, but live under Kubernetes where the privilege
  *     comes from the `x-user-computing-unit-access` header.
  *   - the catch-all error mapper, which turns any exception into a `WorkflowFatalError`, routes it
  *     either to the execution's metadata store or (with no execution) straight to the socket, and
  *     then rethrows so the container sees it too. Both halves are asserted: dropping either the
  *     send or the rethrow would leave the other silently missing.
  *
  * Worth knowing, and the reason there is no malformed-frame test here: `objectMapper.readValue`
  * sits OUTSIDE the try, so an unparseable frame escapes un-mapped and the client is told nothing.
  * That looks like an oversight, but pinning today's behaviour would cement it.
  *
  * Everything here drives a mocked `javax.websocket.Session` (the pattern `CollaborationResourceSpec`
  * established) and registers a `SessionState` directly, so no real workflow is created.
  *
  * Deliberately not covered, because each would pin an accidental failure rather than a contract:
  *   - `myOnOpen`'s missing-`wid`/`cuid` and bogus-privilege paths, which fail with NPE /
  *     IndexOutOfBounds / IllegalArgumentException. A harmless improvement (a default, or a clear
  *     message) would break such a test.
  *   - `ModifyLogicRequest` with a workflow but no execution: `executionService.getValue` is null,
  *     so the handler NPEs instead of reporting "workflow execution is not initialized". Same guard
  *     gap as `case other` below — reported, not pinned. It is also the only input that would tell
  *     `if (workflowStateOpt.isDefined)` apart from `if (executionStateOpt.isDefined)`, so that
  *     guard's exact condition is left unpinned on purpose; see the no-workflow case below.
  *   - `ResultPaginationRequest`'s real payload, which needs a DB; only the request/response
  *     pass-through is asserted here, against a stubbed result service.
  *   - the deserialization line, already owned by `TexeraWebSocketRequestSpec`.
