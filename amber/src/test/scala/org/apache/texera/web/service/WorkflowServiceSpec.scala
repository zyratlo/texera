/**
  * Unit tests for the per-workflow service that outlives a single execution: it owns the
  * cross-execution state store, republishes each new execution to every connected client, and
  * decides what becomes of the previous execution's subscriptions when a new one arrives.
  *
  * Two collaborators are stubbed, both for reasons that would otherwise make these paths
  * untestable rather than merely inconvenient:
  *
  *   - `lifeCycleManager`. The real one schedules the clean-up through `AmberRuntime`'s global
  *     actor system, which no unit test starts, and its callback reads `workflow_executions` from
  *     the database and shuts down the execution's Amber client. Stubbing it also makes the two
  *     things `WorkflowService` actually contributes here observable: that `connect` registers a
  *     user, and that `disconnect` reports the *current execution's* state (the value that decides
  *     whether clean-up is postponed).
  *   - `resultService`, so that the third line of `unsubscribeAll` is pinned. A real
  *     `ExecutionResultService` holds no subscriptions until `attachToExecution` gives it a live
  *     Amber client, so "unsubscribed" would be indistinguishable from "never called".
  *
  * Executions are real `WorkflowExecutionService` instances with `coordinatorConfig`/`resultService`
  * passed as `null` (the pattern `WorkflowExecutionServiceSpec` establishes: construction does no
  * external work), so the events observed here travel through the production diff handler.
  *
  * Two cases run `initExecutionService` end to end against `MockTexeraDB`, for the previous-run
  * clean-up it performs before inserting the new execution row. Both are steered into a
  * compilation failure (a CSV scan with no file selected, the recipe `SyncExecutionResourceSpec`
  * establishes) so the method stops inside `executeWorkflow` and never reaches
  * `ComputingUnitMaster.createAmberRuntime`, which builds an `AmberClient` on
  * `AmberRuntime.actorSystem` — null outside a started coordinator. That stopping point is
  * asserted rather than assumed: it rests entirely on `executeWorkflow`'s early `return`, and
  * without the assertion, removing that `return` would send this "unit" test into
  * `createAmberRuntime` on whatever actor system another suite left installed in the shared JVM,
  * still green, because `initExecutionService`'s catch-all absorbs the fallout.
  *
  * `clearExecutionResources` reaches real storage, so only part of it is observable in process.
  * Pinned here: which execution it selects (workflow *and* computing unit, newest only), that it
  * deletes exactly that execution's registry rows, and that it reads the registered URIs *before*
  * deleting the rows that hold them. Admitted survivors, listed so the coverage numbers are not
  * mistaken for behaviour:
  *   - `LargeBinaryManager.deleteByExecution` (the last line). Its injectable overload is
  *     `private[util]` and the call site uses the one-arg one, so deleting the line, or handing
  *     it a different execution id, is invisible here. It also issues a REAL S3 delete against
  *     the configured endpoint on every run of this suite (`http://localhost:9000` by default).
  *     That is why the fixtures below pin explicit eids in the 941100 range instead of taking the
  *     `SERIAL`: a fresh `MockTexeraDB` database hands out eid 1, and `objects/1/` is the prefix
  *     `LargeBinaryManager` shares with its DEFAULT_EXECUTION_ID sentinel — a developer with
  *     `bin/local-dev.sh up` running would have that prefix recursively deleted for real.
  *   - the runtime-statistics block. Its URI column is NULL in every fixture, so the loop body
  *     runs zero times; a non-NULL value there would abort the whole method (see below) before
  *     the execution insert this suite also pins.
  *   - which arm of `WarehouseReadGuard.skipWhileDisabled` either loop takes: both arms end in
  *     `DocumentFactory`, which needs a live Iceberg/LakeFS backend, and the loop body swallows
  *     every `Throwable`.
  *   - swapping the two URI reads with each other. That is an equivalent mutant, not a gap: the
  *     two lists are concatenated and every element is treated identically.
  *
  * Not a contract, and deliberately not pinned as one: `WarehouseReadGuard.skipWhileDisabled` and
  * `WorkflowExecutionsResource`'s `URI.create` both sit *outside* the per-URI catch, so a single
  * registry row whose URI does not decode aborts `initExecutionService` before the new execution
  * row is even inserted — after which the user can start no run at all of that workflow.
  * Best-effort clean-up should survive an undecodable row; this is a robustness gap worth fixing.
  * The read-order case below uses it only as the one in-process witness that the reads happen
  * while the rows still exist. If the gap is ever closed, re-point that case at whatever new
  * evidence shows the read happened — do not delete it, the ordering it pins is real.
  *
  * Deliberately not covered:
  *   - the replay block of `initExecutionService`. It only mutates a local `CoordinatorConfig`
  *     whose `stateRestoreConfOpt` is read past the compilation failure, so on every path a unit
  *     test can reach it has no observable effect at all; pinning it would mean reflecting into
  *     `WorkflowExecutionService`'s private field.
  *   - the fault-tolerance block of `initExecutionService`, gated on
  *     `ApplicationConfig.faultToleranceLogRootFolder`: a `val` on a Scala `object` with no
  *     override seam, read at class-initialization time in a JVM shared with every other suite.
  *   - `lastCompletedLogicalPlan` and the constructor's `executionService.subscribe` block that
  *     maintains it. Nothing in the repository ever reads that field, so a test could only assert
  *     which plan a write-only var holds — cementing code that should be deleted instead. Worth
  *     knowing if it ever acquires a reader: the completion diff handler runs only while something
  *     consumes the metadata store's websocket-event stream, so the snapshot silently does not
  *     happen when no client is connected.
  *   - `resolveLakekeeperWarehouseName`, owned by `WorkflowServiceWarehouseSpec`.
