"""Unit tests for the loop runtime: LoopStartOperator and LoopEndOperator.

These exercise the abstract base classes in operator.py that the
generated `ProcessLoopStartOperator` / `ProcessLoopEndOperator` classes
extend. The tests use minimal stub subclasses that mirror what
`LoopStartOpDesc.generatePythonCode` / `LoopEndOpDesc.generatePythonCode`
emit so the behavior covered here is the same shape that ships at
runtime.

Coverage:
  - LoopStart's first-entry state merge into self.state.
  - LoopEnd's process_table identity yield; condition is abstract.
  - The guarded eval/exec helpers (eval_output / run_update / eval_condition)
    keep the reserved `table` name out of the persistent loop state, so user
    code cannot silently clobber loop machinery. The table never rides the
    State content: the runtime reads it from the Loop Start's input-port
    materialization and injects it via attach_loop_table; a user loop variable
    named `table` is a raised collision, not a silent drop
    (TestReservedNameCollision).
  - A multi-iteration loop driven to completion through the operators and the
    State to_tuple/from_tuple round-trip (TestLoopRunsToCompletion).
  - The exact generated-code shape -- base64 + decode_python_template + exec,
    with quote/newline-bearing expressions (TestGeneratedCodeShape).
  - Loop expressions that use generator expressions / comprehensions / lambdas
    over loop variables resolve (eval/exec namespace passed as globals), and
    exec's injected `__builtins__` never leaks into the persisted state
    (TestLoopExpressionScoping).

loop_counter and the LoopStart jump metadata (LoopStartId) are owned by the
worker runtime, not these operators -- they ride the StateFrame envelope as
their own columns (the loop-back write address is setup config, not state) --
so their handling is covered in test_main_loop.py::TestMainLoop.
