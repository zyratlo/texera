  * `/callback/orcid` with, and this trades it for the identity behind it. That code is useless
  * without `clientSecret`, which is the only reason it may travel through a browser at all.
  *
  * ORCID asserts no email under the `/authenticate` scope the login page requests, so the account
  * provisioned here has a NULL email and is deliberately not matched against any existing account.
  * See [[ExternalIdentity]] for why that is the safe reading, and `AuthResource.setEmail` for how an

  /**
    * What the login page needs to build its authorize redirect.
    *
    * A deployment missing any of the four settings the flow needs is reported unavailable rather
    * than answered with blanks. The login page enables its ORCID button the moment this resolves,
    * and each blank fails later and worse: an empty `client_id` lands the user on an ORCID error
    * page, and an empty `redirect_uri` gets the exchange rejected after they have already
    * consented. Failing here instead leaves the button disabled behind "ORCID sign-in is
    * unavailable", which is what the page already does with a failed fetch
    * (`texera-login.component.ts`).
    *
    * `redirectUri` is answered rather than left to the browser to derive, because ORCID requires
    * the authorize call's `redirect_uri` and the token exchange's to match byte-for-byte and
    * [[exchangeCode]] sends the configured one. Deriving the authorize leg from
    * `window.location.origin` instead would give that pair two independent owners, and any
    * disagreement — a deployment reached over a host, port or scheme other than the registered
    * one — shows up only after the user has consented, as "Login credentials are incorrect."
    * Serving it here makes this the single owner.
    *
    * `clientSecret` is checked here even though only [[exchangeCode]] sends it, and `baseUrl`
    * because it is easily emptied: the deployment templates ship these for an operator to fill in,
    * and HOCON treats an env var set to "" as set, so it overrides the config default. An empty
    * `baseUrl` would otherwise answer with the relative `authorizeUrl` "/oauth/authorize", which
    * navigates the SPA to itself instead of ORCID.
