  * What a registration attempt produced.

  * `accessToken` is the JWT that signs the new account in. It is not the six-digit proof that
  * `UserRegistrationRequest.code` carries the other way: that one is mailed to the address and
  * comes back from the browser, and never appears in a response.
  *
  * A null token *is* the "a code was mailed, nothing created" signal, reported no other way so the
  * two cannot drift apart. Distinct from [[TokenIssueResponse]] only because that one promises a
  * token.
