Thank you for your interest in contributing to Texera! This guide explains how to contribute to both **Texera’s codebase** and **documentation**.  
We follow a fork-based workflow and adopt the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for commit messages.

## 🛠 How to Contribute Code

### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork the [Texera repository](https://github.com/apache/texera) on GitHub and clone it locally.

### 2. Find or Open an Issue
- Pick an existing issue or create a new one describing your proposal or bug.
- Discuss your approach with committers before coding to reach consensus.

### 3. Create and Submit a Pull Request
- Develop in a new branch of your fork.

  > **Modifying the SQL schema?**  
  > Be sure to update `sql/changelog.xml` by adding a new `<changeSet>` element.  
- When ready, submit a PR to the main Texera repository.
- **Allow edits from maintainers** to let committers make small fixes if needed.

#### PR Title and Commit Format
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
- Example PR titles:
  - `feat: add new join operator`
  - `fix(frontend): resolve workflow panel crash`
  - `chore(deps): bump dependency versions`
- The PR title becomes the final squashed commit message upon merge.

A scope names the module the change lands in — `amber`, `pyamber`, `frontend`, `agent-service`, `file-service`, and so on. Use the module's own name rather than an informal synonym, and when a PR spans modules, scope it to the one carrying the substantive change.

Pick the type by what happens to the behavior, not by how large the change is:

| Your change | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| A functionality worked before and no longer does | `fix` |
| A functionality or a form of support never existed and you are adding it | `feat` |
| A functionality exists and you are removing support for it | `feat` |
| A functionality is reworked in a way that intentionally changes user-facing behavior | `feat` |
| The change leaves the user-facing behavior unchanged | `refactor` |

Behavior is defined by the code, not by what a document or an old PR description says the code does. A functionality that was never implemented does not exist, so implementing it is a `feat` even when the docs already described it as present.

`refactor` claims the **user-facing** behavior is identical. A test that pins a user-facing API must keep passing untouched — changing one of its assertions means the behavior moved, so the PR is a `feat` or a `fix`. A test that pins internals mirrors the implementation and may be rewritten alongside the code it mirrors.

Test and dependency PRs take the titles below. Where the table shows a two-part scope, it is written as `<type>(<area>, <module>): <description>`:

| Your change | Title |
| ----------- | ----- |
| A test-only PR — adding or updating tests | `test(<module>): ...` |
| Repairing a broken or flaky test | `fix(test, <module>): ...` |
| A dependency bump that patches a CVE | `fix(deps, <module>): ...` |
| Any other dependency bump | `chore(deps, <module>): ...` |

Omit the module for bumps that span modules. GitHub Actions bumps are dependency bumps too and take the `ci` module — `chore(deps, ci): ...`, or `fix(deps, ci): ...` when the bump patches a CVE — which is the form Renovate opens them with. Reserve a bare `ci: ...` for hand-written CI and workflow changes.

A PR targeting a release branch appends the version as the last scope component — a backport of `fix(deps, frontend): ...` to `release/v1.2` becomes `fix(deps, frontend, v1.2): ...`. Never put a version tag on a PR targeting `main`.

#### PR Description Should Include:
- **Purpose:** use `Closes #1234` to auto-close an issue.
- **Summary:** short overview of your changes.
- Optional: **design document**, **technical diagram**, or **screenshots**.

Avoid including:
- Local config files (e.g., `python_udf.conf`)
- Secrets or credentials
- Binary or build artifacts

## 🧪 Testing and Quality Checks

### Backend (Scala)
1. Run lint:
   ```bash
   sbt "scalafixAll --check"
   ```
   Fix with:
   ```bash
   sbt scalafixAll
   ```
2. Run formatter:
   ```bash
   sbt scalafmtCheckAll
   ```
   Fix with:
   ```bash
   sbt scalafmtAll
   ```
3. Execute tests:
   ```bash
   sbt test
   ```

> For IntelliJ users: ensure the working directory matches the module (`amber` for engine tests, the repo root for services).

### Frontend (Angular)
1. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ng test --watch=false
   ```
2. Format code:
   ```bash
   yarn format:fix
   ```

Write `.spec.ts` tests for new functionality to ensure future safety.

## 🔍 Pull Request Review Process
1. Request a committer to review your PR.
2. Add labels (e.g., `fix`, `enhancement`, `docs`).
3. Wait for CI to pass ([GitHub Actions](https://github.com/apache/texera/actions)).
4. Mark your PR as **draft** if it’s not ready.
5. Once approved, a committer will merge your PR.

---

## 📝 Apache License Header
All new files must include the Apache License header.  
To automate this in IntelliJ:

1. Go to **Settings → Editor → Copyright → Copyright Profiles**.  
2. Create a profile named **Apache** and add:
   ```
   Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one
   or more contributor license agreements. See the NOTICE file
   distributed with this work for additional information
   regarding copyright ownership...
   ```
3. Set this as the default profile for the project.
