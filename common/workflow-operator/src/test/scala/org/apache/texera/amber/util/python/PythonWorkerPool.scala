/**
  * Pools of persistent Python "worker" processes that eliminate the per-call
  * interpreter-boot + import cost a test otherwise pays on every subprocess
  * spawn. Testing operators one at a time does not scale when each one costs a
  * spawn: a bare `-I -S` interpreter boots in ~25 ms, and once pandas and plotly
  * are imported a spawn costs ~260-310 ms — mostly the imports — dwarfing
  * the ~4 ms of real work a job does. A worker pays that once at startup, then
  * serves many jobs over its lifetime, so N spawns become one.
  *
  * Lives in test scope here, rather than beside a single caller, because tests in
  * several modules run generated operator code and would otherwise each
  * hand-roll a driver, a stdout protocol and a timeout. Other modules reach it
  * through a `test->test` dependency on this one.
  *
  * Generic over the worker script — the pool never interprets the payload — so
  * one implementation serves a syntax check, template execution and DataFrame
  * comparison alike. Each distinct (resource, interpreterArgs, launchArgs,
  * python, env) combination gets its own sub-pool.
  *
  * Protocol (line-delimited JSON, shared by all worker scripts):
  *   startup   worker -> pool:  {"ready": true}
  *   request   pool -> worker:  <caller-supplied JSON object>\n
  *   response  worker -> pool:  {"exit": <int>, "stdout": "...", "stderr": "..."}\n
  *
  * Concurrency: callers submit from several threads at once — one test fanning
  * its cases out, or suites running in parallel — so each sub-pool holds up to
  * [[maxWorkers]] workers, each serving one job at a time (borrow -> run ->
  * return). A worker script may chdir per job, so a worker must never run two
  * jobs at once — the borrow/return discipline guarantees that.
  *
  * Robustness: an ordinary *job* failure comes back as an [[Outcome]] with
  * `exit != 0` (worker keeps running). A hard interpreter crash ends a worker;
  * the pool detects the EOF / broken pipe, discards it, and throws
  * [[WorkerDiedException]] so the caller can fall back to a one-shot subprocess
  * — behavior is then never worse than the pre-pool path. A worker that stays
  * alive but stops answering ends the same way, on the [[Timeouts]] below.
