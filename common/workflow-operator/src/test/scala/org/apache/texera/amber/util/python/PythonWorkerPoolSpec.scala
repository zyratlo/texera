/**
  * What the pool owes a caller when a worker misbehaves. An ordinary job failure
  * is the other suites' business; this one is about a worker that stays alive and
  * stops taking part, which is the case that does not end by itself: a crash
  * closes the pipe and the pending read returns, while silence would hold the
  * caller forever — neither a read nor a write on a process pipe answers an
  * interrupt or a deadline, so no suite-level timeout can release one.
  *
  * Every wait here is bounded and runs on daemon threads, so a regression fails
  * these tests instead of wedging the run: a lost non-daemon thread parked on a
  * pipe would keep the JVM, and the build, alive.
  *
  * The fixture worker is stdlib-only and runs under `-I -S`, so this needs an
  * interpreter but none of the operator packages.
