  * another retry loop by hand. If the work returns a `Future` rather than blocking, use the
  * non-blocking sibling
  * `org.apache.texera.amber.engine.common.Utils.retry` in `amber` instead: it takes the same
  * attempts-and-doubling-backoff knobs but waits on a `Timer`, which matters on an actor or
  * coordinator thread where `Thread.sleep` would stall unrelated work queued behind it.

    * failed attempt) until it succeeds or `maxAttempts` is reached. The final failure is wrapped
    * with `description` and the last exception as its cause.
    *
    * Only `NonFatal` failures are treated as transient, which is the same predicate the
    * non-blocking sibling uses. Note that `NonFatal` admits non-fatal `Error`s -- `AssertionError`,
    * `java.io.IOError`, `ServiceConfigurationError` -- so those are retried rather than propagated
    * straight away. An `InterruptedException` -- raised by the operation or by the wait between
    * attempts -- fails fast with the interrupt status restored, so a caller shutting the thread
    * down is never made to sit through the remaining backoff.
    *
    * @param description        verb phrase naming the work, e.g. "connect to lake fs server". It is
    *                           interpolated into every message: "Failed to $description after ...".
    * @param maxAttempts        total attempts; 1 means no retry at all.
    * @param initialDelayMillis wait before the first retry; doubled after each failed attempt.
    * @param onRetry            invoked before each wait. Log `RetryAttempt.message` through the
    *                           caller's own logger, so retries are attributed to the caller rather
    *                           than to this util.
    * @param sleep              how to wait; injectable so tests exercise the backoff without waiting.
    * @param operation          the work to run, re-evaluated on each attempt.
    * @tparam T whatever `operation` returns.
    * @return `operation`'s value from the first attempt that succeeds.
