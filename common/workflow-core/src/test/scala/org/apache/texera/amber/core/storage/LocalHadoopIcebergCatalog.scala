/**
  * Test-only helper that installs a local Hadoop-backed Iceberg catalog into the
  * shared `IcebergCatalogInstance` singleton exactly once per JVM.
  *
  * The default configured catalog type is `rest`, which needs a live REST server;
  * unit tests instead exercise Iceberg against a temp-directory `file:/` warehouse
  * (via the merged winutils-free local filesystem on Windows).
  *
  * `IcebergCatalogInstance` is a JVM-wide mutable singleton and ScalaTest runs
  * suites in the module in parallel within the same JVM, so every suite that needs
  * an Iceberg backend calls [[ensure]]. Initialization is idempotent and guarded by
  * a single flag on this shared object, so the very first caller wins and all
  * suites end up sharing the same catalog + warehouse instead of racing on
  * `replaceInstance`. Suites keep their tables disjoint via distinct namespaces and
  * unique (UUID) table names.
