/**
  * Makes a versioned LakeFS repository readable inside this computing unit's pod.
  *
  * The mount is not performed here — this pod runs user code and is unprivileged. It asks the
  * mount authority, presenting the pod's own user JWT, and the mount reaches this pod through
  * Kubernetes mount propagation.
  *
  * A repository is addressed by a locator "<repositoryName>:<commitHash>". A commit is
  * immutable, so one mount serves every worker and execution for the life of the pod.
