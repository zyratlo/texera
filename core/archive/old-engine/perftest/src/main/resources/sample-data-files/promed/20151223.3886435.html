She had only been in Paramaribo. On the return flight to the Netherlands, she developed complaints: red skin rash, arthralgias, and a painful skin upon touch. On physical examination, she was not ill, with a maculopapular rash on her trunk and extremities. Blood haematology was normal, except for atypical lymphocytes in the differential. Zika virus infection was confirmed by PCR (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam), on a serum sample taken on 9 Dec 2015 (the 5th day of illness). She recovered quickly.<br><br>Following up on the previous 2 cases with confirmed Zika virus infection imported from Suriname, we diagnosed a 3rd patient (a 54 year old and otherwise healthy male) with a Zika virus infection, who had also visited Suriname (Paramaribo, Domburg, and Commewijne province), from 24 Nov-2 Dec 2015. He developed complaints on [2 Dec 2015] and presented at the emergency department of our hospital on 4 Dec 2015 with fever, arthralgias, muscle aches, and a palpable rash in the neck and on the upper arms, that had progressed to the trunk and lower extremities at the 1st day of follow-up at our outpatient clinic 3 days later, on 7 Dec 2015. The only laboratory abnormalities were a slight leucopenia (3.9 x 10e9/l), with atypical lymphocytes in the differential. The clinical diagnosis of Zika virus infection was confirmed by PCR (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam), on a sample taken on 10 Dec 2015 (9th day of illness). His clinical condition is currently improving. This is the 3rd confirmed case of imported Zika virus infection in one week in returned travelers from Suriname.<br><br>--<br>Abraham Goorhuis, MD, on behalf of the medical team<br>Center of Tropical and Travel Medicine,<br>Academic Medical Center<br>Amsterdam<br>The Netherlands<br>&lt;a.goorhuis@amc.nl&gt;<br><br>[These are additional cases that illustrate the relative speed with which viruses, via viremic patients, can travel around the world, with illness developing far from the locality where the infection was acquired. Fortunately, with the patients arriving in the Netherlands during the onset of winter, with no vector mosquitoes present, there is no chance of ongoing transmission.<br><br>ProMED-mail thanks Dr Goorhuis and colleagues for submitting these case reports.<br><br>It was not surprising that Zika virus arrived in Suriname, since 2 other countries in northern South America -- adjacent Brazil and somewhat more distant Colombia and Venezuela -- have reported ongoing cases. Transmission of the virus is continuing there.<br><br>Maps of Suriname in northeastern South America can be accessed at <a href="http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/southamerica/map-of-Surinam.gif">http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/southamerica/map-of-Surinam.gif</a> and <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37</a>.<br><br>It will be interesting to see if cases of microcephaly occur when pregnant women are infected with Zika virus during their 1st trimester of pregnancy in the other countries that are experiencing Zika virus outbreaks. One hopes that pre-natal healthcare providers are aware of what is going on in Brazil, and that an effective surveillance system with adequate laboratory support is in place. Surveillance and reporting for occurrence of Guillain-Barre syndrome cases following Zika virus infections is important as well. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
