-- Remove the deprecated "project" feature (user projects: colour-tagged
-- collections of workflows, with sharing and public projects). See issue #5172.
--
-- IRREVERSIBLE, USER-VISIBLE DATA LOSS: every project (name, description,
-- colour), every workflow-to-project assignment, every project access grant and
-- every public-project listing is deleted. Workflows, datasets and their own
-- access grants are untouched -- but a workflow that a user could previously
-- reach ONLY through a project share becomes inaccessible to that user, because
-- workflow access is now decided solely by workflow_user_access. Deployment
-- administrators who want to preserve those grants must copy them into
-- workflow_user_access BEFORE applying this migration.
--
-- Dropped in FK-dependency order (children first). The pgroonga index
-- idx_project_pgroonga is dropped implicitly with its table.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public_project;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS project_user_access;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_of_project;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS project;

-- The gui.tabs.projects_enabled key is gone from default.conf, so this seeded
-- row would be orphaned: it is no longer served by /config/settings/public and
-- the admin update endpoint rejects keys with no default.conf entry.
DELETE FROM site_settings WHERE key = 'projects_enabled';
