/**
 * Sign in with Apple, driven through Apple's own SDK because
 * `@abacritt/angularx-social-login` ships no Apple provider. The script is fetched on first use, so
 * a deployment with `appleLogin` off never calls Apple at all.
 *
 * The button is ours rather than `AppleID.auth.renderButton()`'s. Apple's rendered button derives
 * its type size from its height (a 13px label inside a viewBox scaled by `height / 30`) and offers
 * only three logo widths, so it cannot be matched to the Google button beside it. Apple permits a
 * custom button provided it uses their logo artwork and one of their three titles, which is what
 * `assets/logos/apple-logo-white.svg` and the template's label are for.
 *
 * `usePopup` keeps the identity token in the page — Apple posts a form to `redirectURI` otherwise,
 * which would navigate away from the SPA — and that is what lets the token go straight to
 * `/auth/apple/login`. Apple still requires `redirectURI` to be registered against the Services ID
 * and HTTPS on a verified domain; it rejects `http://localhost`, so a local click-through needs a
 * tunnel.
