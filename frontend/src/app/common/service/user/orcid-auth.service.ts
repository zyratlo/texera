/**
 * What the login page needs to send the browser to ORCID: the registered client id, the authorize

 * production), and the redirect URI to come back through.
 *
 * All three come from the server so none of them can disagree with what the backend uses. That
 * matters most for `redirectUri`: ORCID requires the value on the authorize leg to match the one
 * the token exchange sends byte-for-byte, and the exchange sends
 * `user-sys.orcid.redirectUri`. Deriving it here from `window.location.origin` would give the pair
 * two owners, and a mismatch only surfaces after the user has already consented.
