 * underneath -- the final step's output plus the author's chosen view-result steps, each a table, a
 * visualisation, or a compact "no result yet" -- reading the canvas's view-result set and never
 * writing it. A reader can also click a step on the embedded preview to open its property panel
 * read-only: the panel writes nothing to the shared workflow and its content is inert. With write
 * access, an Edit toggle turns the page into in-place authoring: rename an input or its sub-fields,
 * hide a sub-field, reorder inputs by drag, expose a new one by clicking a step (the panel goes
 * live and its writes turn on), remove one, write the instruction, and pick which extra results to
 * feature. A view, not a new object: every graph edit goes through the same shared graph the
