/**
 * Turns a Python script into notebook-style cells using the line ranges the LLM reported
 * for each UDF.
 *
 * A notebook arrives already split into cells, and those cells are the join key for the
 * cell<->operator mapping that drives highlighting. A script has no such boundaries, so the
 * model is asked which lines it turned into which UDF, and the cells are derived from that
 * answer here.
 *
 * The model's answer is untrusted: ranges can arrive reversed, overlapping, out of order,
 * past the end of the file, or missing entirely. Every case is reconciled rather than
 * rejected, because the ranges arrive alongside a workflow that already cost a full
 * conversion, and a degraded mapping is worth more than a discarded result.
 *
 * Guarantees, given a non-empty script:
 *   - Every line with content lands in exactly one cell, whether or not a UDF claimed it.
 *   - Cells are disjoint and ordered by position in the file.
 *   - No cell straddles a reported boundary, so a cell claimed by a UDF is claimed whole.
 *   - Lines two UDFs both claim become one shared cell that maps to both, which is what
 *     `cell_to_operator` already expresses for notebooks.
