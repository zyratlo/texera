   * the next `userChanged` emission is the outcome worth routing on. The replayed current value is
   * skipped because `UserService.handleAccessToken` has already published it by the time we get
   * here — it is the unresolved state, not an outcome.

   * `loginWithExistingToken` returns a user.
