/**
 * jsdom doesn't implement the SVG geometry APIs (`SVGSVGElement#createSVGMatrix`,
 * `createSVGPoint`, `createSVGTransform`, `getScreenCTM`, `getCTM`,
 * `getBBox`). jointjs reaches into these during graph layout and crashes
 * the spec build with `TypeError: svgDocument.createSVGMatrix is not a
 * function` etc.
 *
 * The stubs below return identity-ish geometry: matrices/points behave like
 * the identity, bounding boxes report zero dimensions. That's enough for
 * jointjs construction code to not throw; specs that actually depend on
 * accurate geometry should run under Vitest browser mode rather than
 * jsdom (tracked in #4861), but the bulk of the texera specs only need
 * jointjs to instantiate cleanly.
