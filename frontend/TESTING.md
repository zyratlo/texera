`src/main.test.ts` is intentionally a near-empty `export {}`. The `unit-test` builder uses `buildTarget`'s `main` to seed the bundle graph; if it pointed at the real `main.ts`, every component declared in `AppModule` would be type-checked for every spec, surfacing template errors for components no active spec touches. Keeping `main.test.ts` empty narrows the graph to what each spec actually imports.

## Running tests

```bash
# default — jsdom, watch off
yarn test

# the same, with coverage in lcov form (CI shape)
yarn test:ci

# only the specs routed to real browser DOM (Playwright Chromium)
ng run gui:test-browser

# coverage report you can open in a browser
yarn test -- --coverage --coverage.reporter=html
# then open coverage/index.html
```

Single-file and watch loops use Vitest's own filtering:

```bash
ng test --test-file src/app/workspace/component/workflow-editor/mini-map/mini-map.component.spec.ts
```

## Why `detectChanges()` is the coverage switch

Angular's Ivy compiler turns each component template into a TypeScript function:

```ts
function MiniMapComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {
  if (rf & 1) {
    // creation pass
    ɵɵelementStart(0, "div");
    ɵɵlistener("click", () => ctx.onClick());
    ɵɵtext(1);
    ɵɵelementEnd();
  }
  if (rf & 2) {
    // update pass
    ɵɵadvance(1);
    ɵɵtextInterpolate(ctx.label);
  }
}
```

This function is **not** invoked by the component constructor; it runs only during change detection. The Vite build emits source maps that map each `ɵɵ…` call back to the `.html` line that produced it, and v8 coverage records hits against that source-mapped location.

Consequences:

- `TestBed.createComponent(C)` alone covers the constructor but leaves the template at 0 %.
- A single `fixture.detectChanges()` runs the creation pass and the first update pass; most ordinary `.component.html` files jump to 70 – 90 % from this one call.
- Branches gated by `*ngIf="cond"` need a second `detectChanges()` with `cond` toggled to cover the other side. The same applies to `*ngFor` over an empty vs non-empty array, and to `[ngSwitch]` cases.

If `.component.html` shows 0 % after your spec runs, you almost certainly hit one of the [anti-patterns](#anti-patterns) — most often the constructor compiled and "should create" passed but `detectChanges` was never reached.

## Recipes

### A. Minimum viable spec

Use this as the starting point for any new component. It already covers the template's creation pass.

```ts
import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from "@angular/core/testing";
import { HttpClientTestingModule } from "@angular/common/http/testing";
import { commonTestProviders } from "../../../common/testing/test-utils";
import { MyComponent } from "./my.component";

describe("MyComponent", () => {
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyComponent>;
  let component: MyComponent;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [MyComponent, HttpClientTestingModule],
      providers: [...commonTestProviders],
    }).compileComponents();
  });

  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });

  it("should create", () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### B. `*ngIf` branches

Each `*ngIf` is a separate sub-template. To cover both sides, run `detectChanges()` once per branch:

```ts
it("hides the run button while running", () => {
  component.isRunning = false;
  fixture.detectChanges();
  expect(fixture.nativeElement.querySelector(".run-btn")).toBeTruthy();

  component.isRunning = true;
  fixture.detectChanges();
  expect(fixture.nativeElement.querySelector(".run-btn")).toBeNull();
  expect(fixture.nativeElement.querySelector(".pause-btn")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### C. Event handler

```ts
import { By } from "@angular/platform-browser";

it("calls onRun() when the run button is clicked", () => {
  const spy = vi.spyOn(component, "onRun");
  fixture.detectChanges();
  fixture.debugElement.query(By.css(".run-btn")).triggerEventHandler("click", null);
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();
});
```

Prefer `triggerEventHandler("click", null)` over `nativeElement.click()` when the binding goes through Angular event syntax — it goes through the Angular renderer and survives renderer-2 vs DOM-renderer differences.

### D. Component talking to a stubbed service

Reuse existing `Stub…Service` doubles where they exist. Where they don't, spread a fresh `vi.fn()` mock through `providers`:

```ts
import { OperatorMetadataService } from "../service/operator-metadata/operator-metadata.service";
import { StubOperatorMetadataService } from "../service/operator-metadata/stub-operator-metadata.service";
import { of } from "rxjs";

beforeEach(async () => {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    imports: [MyComponent, HttpClientTestingModule],
    providers: [
      { provide: OperatorMetadataService, useClass: StubOperatorMetadataService },
      {
        provide: WorkflowPersistService,
        useValue: {
          persistWorkflow: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(of(stubWorkflow)),
        },
      },
      ...commonTestProviders,
    ],
  }).compileComponents();
});
```

### E. Component with async data (HTTP, RxJS)

For HTTP-driven flows, `HttpClientTestingModule` is enough; `await fixture.whenStable()` flushes pending microtasks:

```ts
it("loads the workflow on init", async () => {
  fixture.detectChanges();
  await fixture.whenStable();
  expect(component.workflow).toEqual(stubWorkflow);
});
```

For timers (`debounceTime`, `setTimeout`, `interval`), use `fakeAsync` + `tick`:

```ts
import { fakeAsync, tick } from "@angular/core/testing";

it("debounces the query before firing", fakeAsync(() => {
  component.query$.next("foo");
  tick(199);
  expect(search).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  tick(1);
  expect(search).toHaveBeenCalledWith("foo");
}));
```

`fakeAsync` works because `test-zone-setup.ts` installs a ProxyZone around `it`/`test`. It does **not** install one around `beforeEach`, so do not write `beforeEach(fakeAsync(...))` — set component state and call `tick()` from inside the `it` body instead.

### F. Stub a child component (rare, only when the child can't be instantiated)

Standalone parents pull their `imports:` graph in transitively, so most child components instantiate cleanly. Reach for this recipe only when a child genuinely can't run under jsdom — e.g. it requires WebGL, opens a real WebSocket, or depends on a service whose stub you cannot reasonably complete.

Declare a minimal `@Component` with the **same selector** as the real child, mark it `standalone`, and swap it in via the additive override:

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { HeavyChildComponent } from "./heavy-child.component";

@Component({
  selector: "texera-heavy-child",
  standalone: true,
  template: "",
})
class StubHeavyChildComponent {}

beforeEach(async () => {
  TestBed.overrideComponent(ParentComponent, {
    remove: { imports: [HeavyChildComponent] },
    add: { imports: [StubHeavyChildComponent] },
  });

  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({ imports: [ParentComponent] }).compileComponents();
});
```

The parent's template still renders — the `<texera-heavy-child>` tag now resolves to the stub. Coverage of the parent's `.component.html` is unaffected.

Two patterns to **avoid** even when a child is awkward:

- `overrideComponent({ set: { imports: [], schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA] } })` — the `set` form for imports has known Angular bugs ([angular/angular#48432](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48432)), and the schema escape hatch quietly hides real template errors. Use `remove + add` instead.
- `overrideComponent({ set: { template: ... } })` — substituting the parent's template (empty or stub) pins the real `.component.html` to 0 % coverage forever. See Anti-pattern 3.

## Standalone components

Newly-generated components are standalone. The component itself goes into `imports:`, never `declarations:`:

```ts
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [MyStandaloneComponent, HttpClientTestingModule],
  providers: [...commonTestProviders],
});
```

To replace heavy or hard-to-instantiate child components with stubs while keeping the parent template under test, use the `set / remove / add` form of `overrideComponent` **before** `compileComponents()`:

```ts
TestBed.overrideComponent(WorkspaceComponent, {
  set: { imports: [], providers: [], schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA] },
});
```

Working reference: `src/app/workspace/component/workspace.component.spec.ts`.

This drops the children's transitive dependency tree but leaves the parent template rendering — `<ng-template>` tags, `@ViewChild` queries, and event bindings still work because the template itself is unchanged. Do **not** use `set: { template: "" }` — that erases the template and guarantees 0 % HTML coverage.

## jsdom vs browser mode

Default path (`gui:test`, `vitest.config.ts`) runs every spec under jsdom. Fast, no browser boot, works for the overwhelming majority of component logic.

Browser path (`gui:test-browser`, `vitest.browser.config.ts`) runs in real Chromium via Playwright. Use it **only** for the cases jsdom can't fake:

| Spec needs                                                            | jsdom verdict           | Action       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| `getBoundingClientRect()` / `offsetWidth` with real layout            | Returns zeros           | Browser mode |
| `SVGGraphicsElement.getScreenCTM()` for SVG coordinate math (jointjs) | Returns identity matrix | Browser mode |
| Pointer-event hit testing (`elementFromPoint`, drag-and-drop)         | Misses elements         | Browser mode |
| CSS-driven visibility / scroll measurements                           | Unreliable              | Browser mode |
| Plain DOM tree assertions, classes, attributes, text content          | Fine                    | jsdom        |
| Event handlers, observables, services, routing                        | Fine                    | jsdom        |

Routing rules: per-spec inclusion / exclusion is set in `angular.json`, not in `vitest.config.ts`. The comment in `vitest.config.ts` explains why — duplicating the list there triggers a Vite warning and the builder-side filter wins anyway.

Working reference (browser mode): `src/app/workspace/component/workflow-editor/workflow-editor.component.spec.ts`. See [#5017](https://github.com/apache/texera/pull/5017) for the rationale behind the two-target split.

## Mocking

### Functions / spies

```ts
const onClick = vi.fn(); // bare mock
const persist = vi.fn().mockReturnValue(of(stubWorkflow)); // returns Observable
const search = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue([1, 2]); // returns Promise
const spy = vi.spyOn(component, "onRun"); // spy without replacing
```

### Service doubles

Prefer a sibling `Stub…Service` class (the `StubOperatorMetadataService` pattern is the model) when the service is used by more than one spec. They live next to the real service and are imported by name; they keep the spec setup terse and the mock surface consistent across the codebase.

For one-shot mocks, an inline `useValue` with `vi.fn()` is fine, but if you find yourself copying the same `useValue` block across specs, lift it to a `*.stub.ts` next to the service.

### RxJS

Replace methods that return `Observable<T>` with `vi.fn().mockReturnValue(of(value))` or `mockReturnValue(EMPTY)` / `mockReturnValue(throwError(() => err))`. For multi-emission streams expose a `Subject` you control and call `subject.next(...)` from inside the test.

## Anti-patterns

The patterns listed below are the ones that have actually appeared in this codebase. Each ships a real fix.

### 1. Fully commented-out spec

The license header is the only live code; the file reports "0 tests, 0 failures" and Vitest counts it as a pass. The corresponding `.component.html` stays at 0 %.

**Fix**: delete the commented code outright (git history keeps it). Either replace it with the minimum-viable spec from Recipe A, or remove the spec file entirely.

### 2. `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA`

`schemas: [NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA]` tells Angular to swallow every "unknown element / unknown attribute" error from the template. [Angular's own docs warn against it](https://angular.dev/guide/testing/components-scenarios): "you could waste hours chasing phantom bugs that the compiler would have caught in an instant." Even when the spec only asserts on the component class, the schema masks template typos and silently disabled bindings.

For standalone components the schema is also almost always unnecessary. A standalone parent declares its template's children in its own `imports:` array, and TestBed loads that import graph transitively — so the children are "known" without any schema. NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA in a spec is usually a leftover from the pre-standalone NgModule era.

**Fix**: remove `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` and let the test run. The typical failure modes and how to handle them:

- _A child component's `ngOnInit` throws because a service method is missing on the mock._ Extend the service stub — that's where the real coupling lives, not in the template. (Example: the menu spec needed `getAllComputingUnits: () => of([])` added to its `ComputingUnitStatusService` stub once the child's `ngOnInit` started running.)
- _A child component genuinely cannot be instantiated in jsdom (WebGL, native module, etc.)._ Stub it via the additive override — see Recipe F.

ESLint enforces this rule on `*.spec.ts` files; importing `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` from `@angular/core` is a lint error.

### 3. `overrideComponent({ set: { template: "" } })`

Erases the parent's template at test time. `fixture.detectChanges()` then renders an empty `<div>`, the original `.component.html` is permanently pinned at 0 %, and every `*ngIf` / `(click)` / `{{ binding }}` in the file is silently uncovered.

**Fix**: delete the `overrideComponent({ set: { template: ... } })` block. If the spec then errors because of a child, address it the same way as Anti-pattern 2 — extend the service stub, or stub the child via Recipe F. Do not replace the template with an empty-imports override either (see Anti-pattern 8).

ESLint enforces this rule on `*.spec.ts` files; the literal `template: ""` inside `overrideComponent` is a lint error.

### 4. `declarations: [StandaloneComponent]`

Angular errors out at compile time with "Component is standalone and can't be declared in any NgModule".

**Fix**: move the component to `imports:`.

### 5. `beforeEach(waitForAsync(() => …))`

`test-zone-setup.ts` wraps `it`/`test` in a ProxyZone but **not** `beforeEach`. `waitForAsync` throws "Expected to be running in 'ProxyZone'" the moment it tries to detect the zone.

**Fix**: `beforeEach(async () => { await TestBed.configureTestingModule(...).compileComponents(); })`.

### 6. Real HTTP / WebSocket calls

A spec that requires the dev server to be running, or that opens a real WebSocket, is not a unit test. It will fail in CI for unrelated reasons and slow the whole suite down.

**Fix**: `HttpClientTestingModule` for HTTP; a `Subject` you `.next()` into for WebSocket-shaped observables.

### 7. One-off `useValue` mock when a `Stub…Service` exists

Drift: spec A invents a partial mock for `OperatorMetadataService`, spec B invents a different partial mock, none of them agrees with the real interface, and a refactor breaks all three differently.

**Fix**: use `StubOperatorMetadataService`. When you find yourself wanting a new method on the stub, add it to the stub class, not to the spec.

### 8. `overrideComponent({ set: { imports: [], schemas: [...] } })`

Strips the parent's transitive imports and combines that with a permissive schema so the template renders against unknown tags. The pattern looks clean but has two problems: the `set` form for `imports` has documented bugs in Angular standalone components ([angular/angular#48432](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/48432)) where the override silently fails when the same component has been compiled by an earlier spec, and the schema escape hatch hides real template errors just like Anti-pattern 2.

**Fix**: use the additive `remove + add` form to swap specific heavy children for stubs — see Recipe F. If only one or two children are problematic, name them explicitly rather than blanket-stripping the whole import list.

ESLint enforces this rule on `*.spec.ts` files; any `template` or `imports` key inside `overrideComponent({ set: ... })` is a lint error.

## Coverage troubleshooting

`yarn test:ci` produces `coverage/lcov.info`; the GitHub-side dashboard is at [app.codecov.io/gh/apache/texera](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/texera). If a `.component.html` shows 0 % even though the spec passes, walk this list top-to-bottom:

1. **Did `compileComponents()` actually resolve?** A missing provider makes `TestBed.configureTestingModule(...).compileComponents()` reject; Vitest reports the spec as failed but coverage still says 0 %. Run the spec locally, read the actual error in the output, and add the missing provider (commonly `HttpClient`, `Router`, `ActivatedRoute`, or a service that pulls in `GuiConfigService`).
2. **Is `fixture.detectChanges()` actually called?** Step through `beforeEach`; an early-throw or a typo means the line is dead code.
3. **Has the template been overridden to `""`**? See Anti-pattern 3.
4. **Does the spec use `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` to silence missing children, and then assert nothing about the rendered children**? Coverage will reflect that the children's branches were never reached. See Anti-pattern 2.
5. **Is the build source-map-enabled?** `angular.json` `gui:test` inherits from `build.test`. Confirm `sourceMap: true` (the default). A custom builder swap can silently turn it off; without source maps, v8 hits land on the compiled JS, not on the `.html`.
6. **Is the file on the exclusion list?** Check `angular.json` for `unit-test` `polyfills` / `include` / `exclude` patterns. Some files in `common/formly/*.type.ts` are intentionally excluded (their license header file mentions TypeFox).
7. **Is the spec routed to a different builder than expected?** If a file is in `gui:test-browser`'s include list, `yarn test` won't run it. Inspect both targets' `include` arrays.
8. **Is the spec file fully commented out?** See Anti-pattern 1. If Vitest reports "0 tests" for the file, this is the cause.
